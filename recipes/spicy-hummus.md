# Spicy Hummus

## Ingredients

- 15-ounce can of chickpeas, drained
- (or 1½ cups cooked chickpeas)
- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ cup well-stirred tahini
- 1-3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- 2 to 3 tbsp water
- 2 tbsp chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- ½ tsp of salt

## Directions

Add tahini and lemon juice to food processor bowl and mix for 1 minute. Scrape
sides and bottom and mix for 30 seconds more. Add olive oil, garlic, cumin and
½ tsp of salt. Mix for 30 seconds or until well blended. Add half of the
chickpeas and mix for 1 minute. Scrape the sites and bottom of bowl and mix
again for 1-2 minutes until smooth. Add 2 tbsp of chipotle peppers (or more if
a very spicy hummus is desired). Mix for 1 minute until smooth. If hummus is
too thick, slowly add 2-3 tbsp of water until desired consistency is reached.
