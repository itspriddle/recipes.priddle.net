# Vincenzo's Marinara Sauce

## Ingredients

- 28 oz crushed tomatoes (1 can)
- 25 grams carrot
- 25 grams celery
- 50 grams yellow onion
- 50 milliliters olive oil
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 50-100 grams basil
- ¼ cup pecorino cheese, grated (optional)

## Directions

For soffritto, blend carrots, celery, yellow onion, and 50 milliliters of
olive oil in a food processor until well blended and smooth. Add 2 tbsp olive
oil to a sauce pot on medium low heat. Add soffritto to sauce pot and cover
bottom of the pan; cover pan with lid and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove cover
and heat for another 5 minutes until soffritto is a light golden brown. Add
tomatoes, salt, pepper, and mix well. Replace lid and simmer for 1 hour. Break
up basil by hand. Remove lid, add basil and pecorino, stir well. Allow to
simmer for another 45-60 minutes without lid so sauce thickens.
