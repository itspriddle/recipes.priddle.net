# Buffalo Chicken Garbage Bread

## Ingredients

- 2 chicken breasts, cooked and chopped
- 2 cups cherry tomatoes
- 1 pizza dough (let sit out 20 mins)
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- ½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 cup Frank's Buffalo Sauce
- ⅓ cup ranch dressing

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425° F. Mix chicken and ½ cup buffalo sauce. On a well floured
surface, spread pizza dough into a rectangular shape. Add ranch dressing and
remaining buffalo sauce and spread across dough. Add chicken, then top with
mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Roll the dough like a pinwheel until you reach
the end. Make sure to tuck the ends into the middle so it doesn't ooze out
while cooking. Spray baking sheet with light coat of non stick cooking spray.
Place garbage bread on pan and bake 20-25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes after
removing from oven.
