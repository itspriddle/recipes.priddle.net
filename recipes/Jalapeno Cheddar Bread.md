# Jalapeño Cheddar Bread

## Ingredients

- 3½ cups bread flour, plus more for dusting
- 2½ cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided
- 2 jalapeños, seeded and coarsely chopped
- 1 jalapeño, sliced into rings, divided
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 cups warm water
- 2¼ teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Directions

In a large bowl, combine bread flour, 2 cups of cheddar cheese, jalapeños, and
salt. In a separate large bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Pour flour
mixture on top of the water and stir until dough forms. Fold edges of dough
toward the center, rotating the bowl each time, folding a total of 8 times.
Cover with a towel and proof for 60 minutes, until almost doubled in size.
Fold dough toward center again 8 more times. Cover and proof another 30
minutes. Add empty dutch oven with lid to oven and preheat to 450° F for 30
minutes. Carefully peel dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured surface.
Flip and brush away excess flour. Fold edges of dough toward center 8 times,
flip and transfer to a piece of parchment paper. Brush top of dough with olive
oil. Sprinkle remaining ½ cup of cheese on top. Score dough with a sharp knife
with an X. Arrange jalapeño rings on top. Place dough with parchment paper in
the dutch oven, cover, and bake for 30 mins. Remove lid and bake another 20
mins, until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack at least 1 hour before slicing.
