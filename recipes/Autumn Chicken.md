- 12 lg cloves Garlic ; peeled
- Pepper ; (to taste)
- 1/2 c Capers ; (plus a bit
- 4 tb Oregano ; dried
- 1 c Red wine vinegar
- 1 c Apricots ; dried
- 4 tb Italian parsley ; (chopped)
- 8 Cornish game hens (or chicken thighs)
- 1 c Prunes ; pitted
- 1 c White wine, dry
- 1/2 c olive oil
- 1 c Brown sugar
- 1 c Green olives ; pitted
- 8 Bay Leaves

Clean hens well under cold water. Pat dry. In a large bowl, combine hens,
garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, vinegar, oil, prunes, apricots, olives, capers
(with juice) and bay leaves. Cover and refrigerate overnight to marinate.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Arrange game hens in 1 or 2 shallow roasting
pans. Spoon all the marinade over the hens. Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar
and pour wine around them. Bake for 1 to 1 1/4 hours, basting frequently,
until golden. Juice should look clear when thigh is pricked with a fork.
Transfer hens, fruit, olives and capers to a serving platter. Moisten with pan
juices and sprinkle with parsley. Pass remaining pan juices in a sauce boat.
NOTES: * Cornish game hens stewed in fruit and sugar -- I originally got this
recipe from the Sunday magazine of the local paper. I served it last year for
Christmas dinner, and its very good. Whats more, this recipe is easy: you just
put everything in a bowl, marinate overnight, then bake until done
