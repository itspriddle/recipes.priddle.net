# Boursin & Tomato Tortellini

## Ingredients

- 1 package of Boursin garlic and herb cheese
- 1 container grape tomatoes
- 2-3 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 2 tsp of fresh chives
- 1 cup fresh basil
- 1 package of tortellini
- 2 large handfuls of fresh spinach
- olive oil
- salt and pepper

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400Â° and set rack to middle position. Place the Boursin in the
center of your ceramic baking pan. Add baby tomatoes followed by crushed
garlic. Drizzle olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add your
fresh chives and basil. Bake 30-35 minutes. Prepare tortellini after about 20
minutes. When tomatoes and Boursin are done baking, use a meat masher to break
the tomatoes and Boursin apart. Add fresh spinach and mix until well combined.
Add drained and cooked tortellini. Season with additional salt to taste. Mix
until tortellini is covered in Boursin and everything is mixed well.
