# Pot Stickers

## Ingredients

- wonton wrappers
- 1Â½ lbs ground pork (85% lean)
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions
- 4 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 egg, beaten
- 5 cups shredded Napa cabbage
- 2-3 cups chicken stock
- olive or vegetable oil
- water

## Directions

Combine pork, ginger, soy sauce, scallions, sesame oil, egg, and cabbage.
Place one heaping teaspoon of pork filling into wonton wrapper. Moisten the
edges of the wrapper, fold in half to make a triangle. Pinch and roll the
edges to seal in filling. Set aside on a lightly floured surface until ready
to cook. In a large pan, heat a few tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Place
several pot stickers in pan to sear one side, packing them close but not
touching. Once seared (1 min or less), add one cup chicken stock and one cup
water and cover pan allowing pot stickers to steam. Cook until liquid is
mostly absorbed.
